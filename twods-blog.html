            Every year in the last week of January and First week of February the markets turn very volatile the reason being the Financial Budget. The financial budget session starts on February 1. Due to which markets can’t decide a designated way of moving. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In this situation Investors can take advantage of any fall as we saw today on 24th of January, 2022. As of today we expect the markets to dip further. Today rumour played a designated role, Acc to some sources the LTCG (Long Term Capital gain ) was likely to be increased from 10% to 15% which caused panic among the big sharks in the market. Global markets weaken on higher bond yields. Dow Jones on 24th January saw a wild swing with dropping more than 1100pts but it ended in green staging a upbeat recovery.

            <br><br> -->

            In our opinion, there’s quite an uncertainty in the markets. Traders are using various methods to avoid risks but the wild swings is making it very hard to catch a winning trade. Its time for investors to stay awake and find bottoms in good companies. Many good firms are available at great discounts. So Go thrift shopping!Do spot the bottom well. For all our fellow traders there are some key points you should focus on right now! 
           <ul>
             <li>
              <b>Market Mood</b> - The current Market mood is quite pessimistic but the main indices are in their comfortable demand zones. You traders should also focus on the budget. For Options traders, A straddle would work the best in their favour. Avoid naked trading because if the swing happens against your position, Then the swing will be huge. Use Adequate risk management and hedging mechanisms.
             </li>
             <li>
               <b>Overtrading </b> - Opening multiple new positions in this hour wont be the most idle choice. Even if your conviction is very strong then buy half of what your capital can afford so incase it goes in the opposite direction you can average it by adding more. So for newbie’s TWODS Capital would advice to not overtrade. For experienced traders we will like to advice you to hedge your risks from time to time and have a backtested Risk Management System. 
             </li>
             <li>
              <b>Never Hold Overnight Positions</b> - The swings which we are seeing today is replicating the global sentiment. Heavy falls in the US Markets is triggering a bearish sentiment in the world Markets with the Fed decision due in a day. Indian markets close at 3:30 while the US Markets open at 8PM. Pertaining to past experiences in panic situations like this, It’s advisable to square off all positions in Intraday to avoid risks from highly volatile US Markets. 
             </li>
             <li>
              <b>Follow Your Roots</b> - You have been an educated trader, Its advisable to follow your roots at this moment. By roots we mean, Always follow strict stop losses and targets. Having control on your Greed and Fear are two traits which make you a good trader and an educated trader. Another thing to think here is, Remember once you said that this company is overvalued and has no profits or the time you spoke “the company is overvalued.” It’s time to stick to your, Many new startup companies are available at discounts of upto 50% but stick to your word and invest in SWAT(Sleep well at Night) and Bluechip companies
             </li>
             </ul>
             Do check this blog-space back as we uncover Budget 2022. There are some of key points everyone should focus on. May the trading gods be in your favour.

              <h4><b>BLUECHIP A SAFE CAVE!</b></h4>
              Blue Chip stocks are stocks of companies that are the pillars of an economy. These companies have a large market capitalisation, stable earnings history, leaders in their domain, and promising growth prospects.
              Think of blue chip stocks as an exclusive club of stocks where only those stocks are permitted who are market leaders in their domains.
              <br>
              While there is no specific definition of Blue Chip stocks, here are some points to define them:
                CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE THEM:-
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Large Companies:-The first way to identify a blue-chip stock is by looking at its market capitalisation. These are usually larger to very-large-cap stocks that are stock market giants in their sectors.</li>
                <li>Market leaders – Blue Chip stocks are leaders of the market in their industry. Some of the best blue-chip stocks in India are Reliance, HDFC, HUL, Infosys, TCS etc.</li>
                <li>Steady Earnings History – It is important to remember that blue-chip companies take decades before they establish themselves as market leaders. Hence, they have a long history of stable earnings.</li>
                <li>Promising Growth Prospects – There are many types of companies in the market. While some companies manage to grow fast due to favourable market conditions, once they reach their peak, the growth prospects look bleak. However, blue-chip companies have promising growth prospects making them excellent investment options.</li>
                </ul>
             <br>
             <b>HOW TO ENTER THIS SAFE CAVE?</b>
             Bluechips are a good set of stocks but identifying the best out of them is more important, so how do you do that?
             Allow the pointers mentioned below,
             <ul>
                <li>Market Capitalisation</li>
                <li>Income of the company</li>
                <li>ROE - Return of Equity</li>
                <li>Valuation of the company</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2><b>WHY A SAFE CAVE?</b></h2>
            <br>
            A blue-chip stock is usually come with benefits including consistent dividends, predictable growth trajectory, and lower volatility. These are considered relatively safer than other stocks.However, you can benefit from them provided you choose the right ones. 
            <br>
            Ensure that you focus on the valuation of the stock/company and avoid overvalued stocks.

            Correction<br></h4></b>
            /kəˈrɛkʃ(ə)n/<br>
            <i>noun</i><br>
            1. the action or process of correcting something. <br><br>
            2. Used to introduce an amended version of something one has just said.<br> <br>

            Here I’m referring to a stock market correction. After the enormous rally in almost all months of 2021. The party came to an end by a sudden fall in the markets. The born of a new variant in South Africa shocked the world and rattled the financial word with uncertainty and pessimism. United States inflation at a 39-year high. Major news which might led to uncertainty fled through news which created havoc among traders and investors.

            The broader market index for India Nifty50 rallied from 15,000 to 18,600 with certain small pull backs. While it is always said that corrections are always steeper on graph and sudden in time. Everyone knew that a correction was inevitable, It was going to come and create panic but a very few were able to time the correction. Here’s a research by Goldman Sachs which show the corrections and the number of months it took to recover.

          Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) were on a continuous selling spree. Domestic Institutional Investors were on a buying spree. There was one more set of participants in the market - The new lads (Retail Investors). For the FII’s and DII’s correction was a discount at the mall while the new age investors who had never seen such a steep correction were really stunned by the fall because of tender their experience was.
          <br><br>

          Corrections have a nature of creating panic which makes it looks like this is the end of the world but the steeper the corrections, faster will be the bounce back. Staying Invested is an art.  Seeing such wild swings in the world of Finance and staying calm needs a nerve of steel. Great Wealth can be compounded by doing nothing. Stock Market is 10% Buying, 10% Selling and 80% doing nothing. 
          <br><br>

          The whole point of publishing this article is to educate everyone that temporary pull backs and corrections are common in the Stock Market. Corrections and Consolidations are good from the long term perspective of the market. The bulls will come back and take charge but you (Yes you impatient) gotta keep your calm
          <br><br>

          <b>Compounding Wealth is important then earning wealth. All pessimism is permanent. Stay Invested.</b>
